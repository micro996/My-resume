    <br>
        I have a foundational understanding of web development and am continuously improving my skills in building websites and web applications. My knowledge includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which acontent, styling, and interactivity. I am familiar with designing simple layouts, working with forms, and ensuring responsiveness for different screen sizes. <br>
      I have explored CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS to style web pages efficiently, making them visually appealing and mobile-friendly. Additionally, I have a basic understanding of JavaScript and how it enhances user interaction by adding dynamic elements such as buttons, menus, and animations. <br>
      I am also learning the fundamentals of backend development, including how servers and databases work. I have a basic understanding of Node.js and Express.js, which help in handling server-side logic, and I am exploring MongoDB for data storage. While I am still at the beginner level, I am eager to expand my knowledge and build full-stack applications in the future. <br>
      I have experience using Git and GitHub for version control, allowing me to track changes and collaborate on coding projects. Additionally, I am learning how to deploy websites using platforms like Netlify and Vercel.<br>
      I am passionate about improving my web development skills and working on small projects to practice my knowledge. I aim to deepen my understanding of frontend and backend technologies, improve my coding efficiency, and eventually work on more complex web applications. <br>
